# Ontrack Timer 

Based on the Pomodoro technique, this is a timer track to help you keep focused on work and to reminde you about breaks. During break times, tips are displayed on screen to relief yourself from stress and work pressure. Tips are based on desk and body strech exercises. You score after each round completed and also, can level up after a few ones.
