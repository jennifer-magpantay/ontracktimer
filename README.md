# Ontrack Timer 

Based on the Pomodoro technique, this is a timer track to help you keep focused on work and to reminde about breaks. Tips are displayed during break times to relief yourself from stress and work pressure. You score after each round completed and also, can level up after a few ones.

This application was developed during the NLW#4, Next Level Week, a full week of online learning promoted by RocketSeat. From 22 Feb to 26 Feb, a deep programming content was well guided by Diego Fernandes, RocketSeat CTO. 

On this intense hands-on experience, all attendants had the opportunity to learn about React, Next, and Typescritp.
